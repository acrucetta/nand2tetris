## Jack Project 09

Adopt or invent an application idea like a simple computer game or some interactive program. Then design and build the application.

You will need the supplied tools/JackCompiler for translating your program into a set of .vm files, and the supplied tools/VMEmulator for running and testing the compiled code.

1. Write your Jack program—a set of one or more Jack classes—each stored in a separate ClassName.jack text file. Put all these .jack files in the program folder.

2. Compile the program folder using the supplied Jack compiler. This will cause the compiler to translate all the .jack classes found in the folder into corresponding .vm files. If a compilation error is reported, debug the program and recompile until no error messages are issued.

 3. At this point the program folder should contain your source .jack files along with the compiled .vm files. To test the compiled program, load the program folder into the supplied VM emulator, and run the loaded code. In case of run-time errors or undesired program behavior, fix the relevant file and go back to step 2.
