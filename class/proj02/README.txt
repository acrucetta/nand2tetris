Write the HDL for, and test, the following chips in this order:

HalfAdder [X]
FullAdder [X]
Add16 [x]
Inc16 [X]
ALU

For the ALU, design it first without the status bits, and test using ALU-nostat.tst and ALU-nostat.cmp. Then implement the status bits and test your chips using the test file included with the project.
