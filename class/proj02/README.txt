Write the HDL for, and test, the following chips in this order:

HalfAdder
FullAdder
Add16
Inc16
ALU

For the ALU, design it first without the status bits, and test using ALU-nostat.tst and ALU-nostat.cmp. Then implement the status bits and test your chips using the test file included with the project.
