## Assignment 1

Write the HDL for, and test, the following logic chips in this order:

Nand [x]
- A Nand gate has two inputs and one output. The output is the inverse of the And gate.
  This means that the output is true if and only if at least one of the inputs is false.

Not [x]
- A Not gate has one input and one output. The output is the inverse of the input.

And [x]
- An And gate has two inputs and one output. The output is true if and only if both inputs are true.

Or [x]
- An Or gate has two inputs and one output. The output is true if and only if at least one of the inputs is true.

Not16 
- Similar to the Not gate but with 16 inputs and 16 outputs.

Xor [X]
- An Xor gate has two inputs and one output. The output is true if and only if exactly one of the inputs is true.

And16 [X]
- Similar to the And gate but with 16 inputs and 16 outputs.

Or16 [X]
- Similar to the Or gate but with 16 inputs and 16 outputs.

Or8Way [X]
- If any of the inputs is 1 then the output is 1. Otherwise the output is 0.
- We will need to come up with internal variable names for each of the pins.

Mux [X]
- A Mux gate has three inputs and one output. The first two inputs are the data inputs, the third input is the selector.
  If the selector is 0 then the output is the first data input, otherwise the output is the second data input.

DMux [x]
- A DMux gate has one input and two outputs. The input is the data input, the first output is the first data output,
  the second output is the second data output. The selector chooses which output to set to the input. If the selector
  is 0 then the first output is set to the input, otherwise the second output is set to the input.

Mux16 [X]

Mux4Way16 [x]

Mux8Way16 [x]

DMux4Way [x]

DMux8Way [TBD]

To Submit:
Put the HDL files only into a folder (directory) 
labeled with your last name, first name, and Project1. 
(Example: smithJohnProject1) Include a README file explaining 
what works and what doesn't, compress the folder and upload.
